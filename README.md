## BrewFind

An RESTful application built with React and Redux that allows users to display their favorite kind of beer. Includes client-side Oauth authentication that talks to the third-party Google API to authenticate users. I used Redux to create RESTful actions in my application that allow you to GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE user inputs.
